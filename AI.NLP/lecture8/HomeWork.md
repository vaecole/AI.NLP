## Home work for Lecture 8

### Summarize the reasons of overfitting and underfitting. Put them in github repository.
#### Underfitting Reasons
- 模型复杂度过低
- 模型特征过少或者不合理
- 数据集过少

#### Overfitting Reasons
- 模型复杂度过高
- 模型特征过多


### install the numpy, scikit-learning, keras, tensorflow
- pip install numpy
- pip install scikit-learn
- pip install keras
- pip install tensorflow


### Writing down three sceneries that machine learning has been used now.
- Map Navigation
- Smart Phone Photo Optimization(like portrait mode)
- Voice Assistant


### Come out with three new sceneries with which machine learning may be applied.
- Cancer or other diseases detection
- Forest fire prevention and detection
- Auto-Programming(Simple Business Scenario)
